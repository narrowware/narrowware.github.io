<p><img src="/assets/images/docker-tuesday/Docker-tuesday.png" alt="Docker Tuesday by Narrowware" /></p>

<p>
Whenever we mention software security, we think of OWASP Top 10. And that's great. While we must protect our app from XSS, MITM, and a whole bunch of other attack vectors, our containers might end up compromising our best efforts. 
Scanning Docker images for security vulnerabilities stands as a crucial best practice in modern software development for several compelling reasons. Docker, while incredibly useful for its containerization benefits, requires vigilant attention to security, especially considering the complex layers inherent in containerized applications.
</p>

<h2>Vulnerable base images</h2>
<p> Let's say you stick with <i>alpine:3.9</i>.
You're confident that the application you've deployed is running, everything seems great, until one day, the service that gets deployed with that container stops working. Your start wondering why.
After some time, you get to find out that the base image - alpine:3.9 has vulnerabilities.
If an attacker knows about these vulnerabilities and exploits them, it could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or compromise of the containerized application.
Seems like in your case, the malicious actors knew about the vulnerable version you've been using all that time. </p>

<h2>How to mitigate</h2>
<p>One of the approaches you can use is a "Continuous security scan" approach where a pipeline in your CI/CD runs security scans on the docker images that you're using. Automated scanning tools enable you to identify vulnerabilities early in the software development lifecycle. This proactive approach saves time, as it allows developers to fix issues at an earlier stage, reducing rework and ensuring that only secure images progress through the pipeline.</p>

<h2>How does Docker help?</h2>

<p> Docker has a very nifty command, which you can use on top of every other solution that you have.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  docker scan
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>should be the first line of defense against potential image security threats.</p>

<h2>What does docker scan do?</h2>
<p>In the background, the service uses a software called Snyk.
Snyk employs databases of known vulnerabilities and security issues, continuously updated with information on emerging threats and weaknesses. By comparing the contents of container images against these databases, security tools flag any identified vulnerabilities, including outdated software versions, weak configurations, or known security flaws.
This tool is available as a docker standalone command, but also you can employ it automatically when you push an image to DockerHub. Custom repositories might not benefit from it, however, you have to utilize tools such as docker scout.</p>

<h2>To sum up</h2>
<p>Scanning Docker images for security vulnerabilities is an integral step in the containerization lifecycle. It serves as a proactive security measure, helping organizations identify and remediate potential risks, fortify their defenses, comply with industry standards, and ensure the safety and resilience of containerized applications in today’s evolving threat landscape.</p>]]></content><author><name>Georgi Spasov</name></author><category term="Traba" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Docker Best Practices: Scanning your images for vulnerabilities]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4124/assets/images/docker-tuesday/Docker-tuesday.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4124/assets/images/docker-tuesday/Docker-tuesday.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Docker Best Practices: Multi-stage Docker build</title><link href="http://localhost:4124/articles/docker-best-practices-multi-stage-docker-build" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Docker Best Practices: Multi-stage Docker build" /><published>2024-01-02T23:38:02+02:00</published><updated>2024-01-02T23:38:02+02:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4124/articles/docker-best-practices-multi-stage-docker-build</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4124/articles/docker-best-practices-multi-stage-docker-build"><![CDATA[<h1>Docker Best Practices: Multi-stage Docker build</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/images/docker-tuesday/Docker-tuesday.png" alt="Docker Tuesday by Narrowware" /></p>

<p>
Utilizing multi-stage Docker builds represents a pinnacle best practice in the domain of containerization, revolutionizing the way developers craft and optimize Docker images. This innovative approach to building container images offers an array of benefits, ranging from enhancing image efficiency and reducing overhead to streamlining development workflows and minimizing security risks.
</p>

<h2> What is a multi-stage build? </h2>
<p> At its essence, the multi-stage build process enables developers to create optimized Docker images by segregating the build into multiple stages, each serving a specific purpose. This approach allows for the creation of intermediate images, where each stage focuses on specific tasks, such as compiling code, installing dependencies, and building the application. Consequently, the final image produced contains only the essential artifacts, excluding unnecessary build dependencies and intermediate files. </p>

<h2>Why should we use a multi-stage Docker build </h2>
<p>One of the key advantages of multi-stage builds lies in optimizing image size and reducing bloat. By discarding unnecessary build artifacts and dependencies in the final stage, developers create leaner, smaller Docker images. This reduction in image size not only accelerates image pull and deployment times but also minimizes the attack surface, bolstering the image's security posture.
Moreover, the multi-stage build process significantly streamlines the development workflow. It facilitates a more organized and efficient development pipeline by separating the build stages, making the process more modular and maintainable. This modularity simplifies debugging, testing, and iterative development, enabling developers to iterate and refine code more rapidly.
Furthermore, multi-stage builds promote better resource utilization. The elimination of redundant dependencies and intermediate artifacts optimizes resource allocation during the build process, reducing the overall resource overhead required for image creation. This efficiency in resource utilization not only speeds up the build process but also contributes to a more sustainable and scalable development environment. </p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>FROM node:18.13.0 AS angular-build
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm i
COPY . .
RUN npm run build -- --configuration production
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=angular-build /usr/src/app/dist angular-client/* /usr/share/nginx/html/
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I’ve chosen to dockerize a simple Angular application.
A very important part of the Dockerfile is the angular-build segment we see on the first line.
The first part (line 1-6) handles the way we build our Angular app - provided we have installed all required dependencies, we run a production build of the product.
Now the first part is complete, we don’t really need to use the bloated node image, we could copy the artifacts produced by the build and place them in a more optimized “environment” - a container that’s spun off from the nginx:alpine image. Why do we need more optimized images, you will ask? Well check out my other article and find out!
The COPY instruction takes the artifacts from the angular-build and places them in a folder that could be utilized by Nginx.
The EXPOSE 80 instruction lets the Docker engine know that the corresponding port will be utilized for the internal communication.
&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<h2>To sum up</h2>
<p>In conclusion, the adoption of multi-stage Docker builds is a cornerstone in modern containerization practices. Its ability to streamline the build process, reduce image size, enhance security, and improve resource utilization makes it an indispensable best practice for developers aiming to optimize their Docker workflows and create efficient, agile, and secure containerized applications.</p>]]></content><author><name>Georgi Spasov</name></author><category term="Docker" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Docker Best Practices: Multi-stage Docker build]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4124/assets/images/docker-tuesday/Docker-tuesday.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4124/assets/images/docker-tuesday/Docker-tuesday.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Docker Best Practices: The power of .dockerignore</title><link href="http://localhost:4124/articles/docker-best-practices-the-power-of-dockerignore" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Docker Best Practices: The power of .dockerignore" /><published>2023-12-26T23:38:02+02:00</published><updated>2023-12-26T23:38:02+02:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4124/articles/docker-best-practices-the-power-of-dockerignore</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4124/articles/docker-best-practices-the-power-of-dockerignore"><![CDATA[<h1>Docker Best Practices: The power of .dockerignore</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/images/docker-tuesday/Docker-tuesday.png" alt="Docker Tuesday by Narrowware" /></p>

<p>
In our quest for Docker mastery, every Tuesday becomes an exploration into the world of containers, as we uncover the tips, tricks, and best practices that elevate your Docker expertise. Today, we embark on a journey into the heart of efficient containerization with a focus on one key aspect: how to we use .dockerignore in a more efficient way?
</p>

<h2> Trimming the fat
</h2>
<p>Remember how you decided to wear that favorite sweater of yours last Christmas and found out it did not fit?
Well, the same goes for docker images.
.dockerignore is your tidy-up tool in Docker world. It's the gatekeeper that ensures only the essentials make it into your Docker images, saving space and keeping things clean. By specifying patterns and paths to be excluded, it prevents the Docker build process from incorporating superfluous files such as development artifacts, temporary files, logs, binaries, and other non-essential resources. This curation minimizes the size of the build context, leading to smaller, more efficient Docker images.</p>

<h2 id="example-dockerignore-of-a-nodejs-app">Example .dockerignore of a NodeJS app</h2>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    **/node_modules/
    **/dist
    .git
    npm-debug.log
    .coverage
    .coverage.*
    .env
    .aws
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2>Swift and Efficient</h2>
<p>Reducing image size through effective use of .dockerignore brings about several advantageous outcomes. Primarily, smaller images translate to faster build times and reduced network overhead during image transfers. This optimization of resources not only expedites the Docker build process but also facilitates quicker deployments, enhancing development agility and enabling faster iterations in continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.


<h2>Locking the Vault
</h2>

<p> Security is a top concern. .dockerignore acts like a gate, only allowing non-sensitive, necessary files into your Docker images. Limiting the exposure of unnecessary files diminishes potential vulnerabilities, safeguarding the Docker images against potential security threats.

<h2> Order from Chaos </h2>

<p>The efficiency gained through .dockerignore contributes to the overall cleanliness and maintainability of Docker projects. By decluttering the build context and ensuring that only essential files are included, developers create more organized, coherent Docker environments. This organization not only streamlines the development process but also simplifies collaboration among team members by providing a clearer and more manageable project structure.


<h2>Precision Engineering </h2>


<p>.dockerignore crafts sleek, purpose-built images. It's the key to images that travel light, adapting effortlessly to various environments. Precision in, efficiency out.

<h2>Developer's Secret Sauce</h2>


<p>The utilization of .dockerignore also aligns with Docker's philosophy of modularity, encouraging the creation of lean, purpose-built images. This practice promotes reusability across projects and environments, as images are tailored to include only necessary components, enhancing portability and scalability across diverse deployment scenarios.



## To sum up

In essence, the integration of .dockerignore into Docker workflows is more than just a best practice; it's a cornerstone of efficient containerization. By embracing selective exclusion, developers empower themselves to create smaller, more secure, and maintainable Docker images, streamlining development processes, fortifying security, and enhancing the overall agility and efficiency of container-based deployments.

Using small-sized official Docker images is considered a best practice in the realm of containerization for a multitude of compelling reasons.

<br />
First and foremost,
<br />

<h2> Small-sized Docker images significantly enhance deployment speed and efficiency</h2>
<p>These lightweight images drastically reduce the time required for container instantiation. The smaller the image, the quicker the deployment process becomes. This swift deployment turnaround is invaluable in modern software development, enabling faster iterations, continuous integration, and seamless delivery pipelines. It directly contributes to enhanced developer productivity and agility in delivering software solutions.
<br />
<h2> Small-sized images contribute to a more efficient utilization of resources </h2>
<p>  When containers are built from smaller images, they consume fewer system resources, including storage space and network bandwidth. This efficiency is particularly crucial in scenarios where numerous containers need to coexist within a limited infrastructure. Reduced resource consumption not only optimizes the utilization of hardware but also lowers operational costs by requiring less storage and network capacity.
<br />

<h2>Smaller images promote better security practices</h2>

<p>By minimizing the image size, the attack surface—areas vulnerable to security threats—also reduces. This reduction in attack surface decreases the potential vulnerabilities within the container, enhancing the overall security posture. Smaller images often mean fewer unnecessary dependencies and less extraneous code, mitigating potential security risks by reducing the potential entry points for malicious attacks.
<br />
<h2>Smaller images facilitate easier sharing and distribution</h2>

<p>When working in a team or across multiple environments, compact images simplify the process of sharing and transferring containers. They reduce the time and effort needed for uploading and downloading images from repositories, optimizing workflows and collaboration among developers and teams. This streamlined sharing process aligns with the principles of DevOps and fosters seamless integration within CI/CD pipelines.

<br />
<br />

In conclusion, the utilization of small-sized official Docker images is a fundamental best practice in modern software development and containerization. It contributes significantly to faster deployment, resource efficiency, enhanced security, simplified sharing, and aligning with Docker's core principles of modularity and reusability. Incorporating these lightweight images into Docker workflows is pivotal in optimizing performance, improving security, and streamlining development processes for modern, agile software delivery.
